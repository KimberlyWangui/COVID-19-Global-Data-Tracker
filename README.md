## 🌍 COVID-19 Global Data Analysis & Reporting Notebook

# 📌 Project Description

This project analyzes global COVID-19 trends using real-world data from Our World in Data. It focuses on key metrics such as cases, deaths, and vaccinations across different countries over time.

Developed in Google Colab, this Jupyter Notebook cleans, processes, and visualizes COVID-19 data, presenting key insights through charts, graphs, and a choropleth map.

# 🎯 Project Objectives

✅ Import and clean COVID-19 data

✅ Analyze time trends for cases, deaths, and vaccinations

✅ Compare metrics across selected countries

✅ Visualize data using matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly

✅ Summarize findings in a narrative report

# 📊 Countries Analyzed
🇦🇹 Austria

🇮🇳 India

🇦🇴 Angola

# 📝 Key Features
📈 Line plots for total cases, deaths, new cases, and vaccination trends

📉 Death rate comparisons over time

📊 Bar and pie charts for country comparisons

🗺️ Choropleth map for global case density

# Key Insights
1. India had the highest cumulative case count among the three countries analyzed.

2. Austria showed a relatively high vaccination rate compared to Angola.

3. Death rates were consistently lower in India compared to Austria despite higher case numbers.

4. Angola had significantly fewer cases, potentially due to lower testing or reporting.

5. Vaccination efforts varied greatly across regions, impacting recovery trends.

# How to Run
1. Open Google Colab
2. Upload the Week8.ipynb notebook
3. Mount your Google Drive and ensure the owid-covid-data.csv is in the specified path
4. Run all cells to generate analysis and visualizations
